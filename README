Have you ever needed to lookup a player (to ban them, send mail to them, check their rank, etc.) only to find yourself unable to remember their name?  If so, PlayerSearch is just what you're looking for!

Simple usage: just type "/lookup <search>" or "/find <search>" and PlayerSearch will give you the names of all players (online and offline) whose names contain <search> - there's no need to remember the player's exact name!

Permissions are just as easy - players can, by default, search for other players. This means no nodes are required!
PlayerSearch does, however, include the node 'playersearch.lookup', so if you want to deny a player access to PlayerSearch, just give them the '-playersearch.lookup' node.
